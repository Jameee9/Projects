# 📁 My Projects – Python, Lua and Full Stack Web Development

Welcome to my personal collection of learning projects!  
This repository serves as a hub for my practice work, learning experiments, and mini applications built during my journey as a Software Engineering student.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo is designed to:
- Track my coding progress
- Showcase practical knowledge in core programming concepts
- Keep things organized and versioned as I learn and build

## 📂 Structure

At the moment, I have been committing projects directly to the main repo as I have been busy with university classes and projects so I have not been able to organize the structure.
